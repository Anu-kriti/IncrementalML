**What is Incremental Learning?**
[Incremental Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_learning) also called as Self Learning/Online Learning. It is a method which allows us to model problem where we have a continuous stream of data coming in. The basic requirement of Incremental ML comes when the training data becomes available gradually over the time which will eventually cost high computation in storing or building the model. The method is applicable for both Supervised and Unsupervised learning techniques. The algorithms which are amenable with Incremental Learning are known as Incremental ML algorithms.

**Why do we need Incremental Learning?**
The general practice of using any model results is to validate the model on the latest data or refresh it with the current data. In case of validation, the model might work well on the current data but we might miss some crucial information present in the new data as we are relying on the model built on old data. In case of refreshing the model, we might miss some information if we rely only on new data or combining all the data might be computationally too high. Online Learning can help us in getting information from the complete data and with less computation cost. The main aim of Online Learning is to store the existing model information and update the model with time as the new information comes in. Instead of building the model on the complete data (prior training set and the new data feed in), online learning will update the model parameters for the existing model obtained from the new data.

**Applications of Incremental Learning?**
Nowadays, largest websites are using different version of Incremental Learning to learn from the flood of users that keep on coming and going back to websites. Online Learning can be used to learn userâ€™s preferences from the stream of data and optimize some of the decisions on the website.
